RN2483 FW revision history:

0.9.5	Initial release
1.0.0	Release for LoRaWAN specification V1.0 
Changes since last release
- Added support for additional RN2483 commands:
    mac set sync
	mac get sync
	mac set upctr
	mac get upctr
	mac set dnctr
	mac get dnctr
	sys set pinmode
	sys get pindig 
	sys get pinana
	radio get sync	
- Added new parameters to be saved in non volatile memory whenever a mac save command is triggered
	LoRaWAN current data rate 
	LoRaWAN RX2 window parameters (data rate and frequency) 
	Adaptive Data Rate status 
	LoRaWAN uplink frame counter 
	LoRaWAN downlink frame counter
- Changed the default value of the End-Device Identifier (deveui)	
- Changed the valid range for the radio set fdev parameter to [0.. 200000]
- Changed the valid range for the radio set bitrate parameter to [1.. 300000]
- Changed sys sleep command behavior to not influence the GPIO configuration
- Changed the 433 MHz radio frequency band to [433050000 .. 434790000]
- Fixed an issue that may have caused the RN2483 module to mishandle data on LoRaWAN port 0
- Fixed an issue that may have cause the module to fail joining
- Fixed "radio get snr" command to display correct value 
1.0.1	Release containing modifications needed to successfully pass the LoRaWAN Certification Program testing in 868 MHz band
Changes since last release
- Added support for usage of the reserved ports, from 224 to 255 for transmitting and receiving Application Data
- Increased the size of the value returned by the "mac get status" command from 2 bytes to 4 bytes
- Updated the size of the LoRaWAN receive windows and the moment in time at which these are opened
- Fixed an issue that may have caused the RN2483 module to mishandle packets received with DR = 7
- Fixed an issue that may have caused the RN2483 module to mishandle the LoRaWAN RXParamSetupReq command
- Fixed an issue that may have caused the RN2483 module to mishandle the usage of LoraWAN ADRACKReq in packets
1.0.2	Release (LoRaWAN specification V1.0)
- Fixed an issue that impacted the current consumed in sleep mode
1.0.3	Release (LoRaWAN specification V1.0.1)
- Fixed the wake up from sleep on UART feature
- Added support for RxTimingSetupAns and RxParamSetupAns responses in uplink frames until the next downlink is received.
- Added support to Ignore downlink frames to port 0 with Mac commands in FOpts and Payload
