1.0.6 RC1
Fixed 'get mac status' to correctly display the 'channelsModified' bit-11.
Fixed issue where LinkADR block could not be decoded if the LinkADRReq block
    was followed by a non-LinkADRReq MAC command in the MAC command block.

1.0.6 RC2
Added code to support sleep times 131072000 ms (0x07D00000) through
    4294967295 ms (0xFFFFFFFF).  Existing code did not support that range.

    system_low_power.c: SysSleepStart()
        - massive change to tick calculation to support 40-bit tick values

    system_low_power.c: OnSleepTimerEvent()
        - added support to use callback parameter to provide extra tick bits

    sw_timer.c
        - added support for modifying callback parameter
            new: SwTimerSetCallbackParam()
            new: SwTimerDecCallbackParam()

    Includes DEBUG_SLEEP instrumentation using GPIO13 to indicate sleep state.

1.0.6 RC3
Restored minimal ticks calculation in SysSleepStart for short sleep durations

1.0.6 RC5
    Validate Autobaud
        - restores previous UART baudrate if ABD operation was unsuccessful
        - adds optional ABD timeout to restore UART communications after
            failed or incomplete break-autobaud operation

    Validate Autobaud - During Sytem Sleep
        - returns to sleep after UART Rx line glitch (was waking forever)
        - break condition must exist for ~78 uS (9-bit times @115200 baud)

    Max UART baud rate is 115200

    Debugged sleep timer issues injected in earlier v1.0.6 RCs

    Added debug to GPIO13 as follows (this will be removed for release)
        GPIO13 high:        RN2903 awake
        GPIO13 low:         RN2903 asleep
        GPIO13 2 pulses:    EUSART1_Receive_ISR started
