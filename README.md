## Software Environment Setup<a name="step3"></a>

### Software Requirements

- [MPLAB X IDE v5.15](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MPLABX-v5.15-windows-installer.exe)
- [XC8 compiler PRO v1.45](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/xc8-v1.45-full-install-windows-installer.exe) (requires Software License)

Checkout the [archive page](https://www.microchip.com/development-tools/pic-and-dspic-downloads-archive).

### IDE Setup

- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Make sure required XC8 compiler is selected by default in **Tools -> Options -> Embedded**
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/mplab_compiler_setup_01.png" width=640>
</p>

### Project Setup

- Open the requested LoRaWAN project from **File -> Open Project** (e.g. `RN2903NA_1.0.6_RC6\Source`)
- Open the project properties from **File -> Project Properties**
- Apply the requested XC8 compiler version for all the configurations (default, offset, combined)
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/project_setup_01.png" width=720>
</p>

- For all the 3 configurations (default, offset, combined), make sure XC8 Compiler optimizations options are set for:
  * Favor optimization for: **Space**
  * Operation mode: **PRO**
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/project_setup_02.png" width=720>
</p>

- Select between **offset** or **combined** from the selection box
<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/project_setup_03.png" width=>
</p>

> Offset configuration is configuring the project in order to compile the project without the bootloader code
> Combined configuration is configuring the project in order to compile both the project and the bootloader code

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/project_setup_04.png" width=>
</p>

- For combined configuration, the **HEX** file generated `RN2xx3_Parser.production.unified.hex` is located into `dist/combined/production`

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/project_setup_05.png" width=640>
</p>

- For offset configuration, the **HEX** file generated `RN2xx3_Parser.production.hex` is located into `dist/offset/production`

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/project_setup_06.png" width=640>
</p>

## Module Programming<a name="step4"></a>

In addition to the LoRa Transceiver, the RN2xx3 modules integrate a [PIC18LF46K22](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC18F46K22) microcontroller which come with 64kB of Flash and 4kB of RAM. The LoRaWAN Firmware resides into the memory of the PIC18LF46K22 microcontroller.

### Combined configuration

#### Requirement

Requires Programming tool such as [MPLAB ICD4](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DV164045) or [MPLAB PICkit4](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/PG164140)

#### Setup

Connect the programming tool to ICSP pins (PCG_INT, PGD_INT, RESET, GND, VCC) as shown in the [datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/RN2483-Data-Sheet-DS50002346E.pdf).

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/typical_hardware_connections.png" width=640>
</p>

#### Programming

* Open MPLAB X IPE
* Select **PIC18LF46K22** target device
* Select the programming tool
* Click **Apply**
* Click **Connect**

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/mplab_ipe_01.png" width=640>
</p>

* Browse for the required HEX file `RN2xx3_Parser.production.unified.hex` located into `dist/combined/production`

<p align="center">
<img src="resources/media/mplab_ipe_02.png" width=640>
</p>

* **Program** the device
* Click **Disconnect**
* Remove the programming tool connection

### Offset configuration

To update the RN2483/RN2903 firmware using Bootloader with a Computer Host or with an Embedded Host checkout the **Chapter 3. Bootloader Usage** of the [User Guide](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/RN2483-LoRa-Technology-Module-Command-Reference-User-Guide-DS40001784G.pdf)

Make sure to use the HEX file `RN2xx3_Parser.production.hex` located into `dist/offset/production`
